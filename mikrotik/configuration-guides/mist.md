This page explains the necessary configuration for Mist Systems Access Points and external Captive Portal with RADIUS authentication.

### IronWifi Console Configuration

1. Log into the IronWifi console or [register for free](https://console.ironwifi.com/register)
2. Create a **new network**
3. After that, create a **new captive portal**, with vendor **Mist Systems**

### **MIST Web GUI configuration**

In the Mist Web GUI, create a Guest WLAN to use your captive portal pages. This action requires an administrator account Network Admin privilege or higher.

1. To start, create a new WLAN by navigating to **Network -> WLANs** and selecting the Add **WLAN** button on the upper right.

2. Under the **Security** section, select the desired WLAN security mode
3. Go to the **Guest Portal** box and select **Forward to the external portal**. Configure with:

- **Portal URL -** {{splash_page_url}}
- **Allowed Subnets -** 107.178.250.42/32

Click **Create** to create the new WLAN on your site. The API Secret will automatically be created for you.

4. Return to the WLAN settings page and copy the **API Secret**.
5. Go back to the IronWifi console and paste the API Secret to **Controller Password** on the Captive Portal settings page.

 ! You must also install a valid SSL certificate on your controller/AP, in order to avoid authentication issues !
