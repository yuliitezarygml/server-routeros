**NOTE:** These IP ranges are subject to change depending on the social network setup.

Click **Apply Changes** to save.

Next, you will need to modify two html on the controller so that it correctly redirects and authenticates. First of all, download the below two files:

- <a href='https://console.ironwifi.com/api/debug?script=portal_file&unifi_file=index&url={{splash_page_url}}' download>index.html</a>
- <a href='https://console.ironwifi.com/api/debug?script=portal_file&unifi_file=auth&url={{splash_page_url}}' download>auth.html</a>


Open the **index.html** file in a text editor (right click on the file and choose your favourite text/code editor) and at the top of this document you will see an item named "splashurl", edit this so that it shows:

**!This has been done automatically if you opened these instructions from the ironwifi console!**

```javascript
var splashurl = "{{splash_page_url}}";
```

Now, you need to copy these two html files to your UniFi controller hotspot directory. This is typically located at the below location:

- Windows: C:\Users\<username>\Ubiquiti UniFi\data\sites\default\app-unifi-hotspot-portal
- MAC: ~/Library/Application Support/UniFi/data/sites/default/app-unifi-hotspot-portal
- Linux: /usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default/app-unifi-hotspot-portal
- UDM Pro: /data/unifi/data/sites/default/app-unifi-hotspot-portal
- CloudKey: /srv/unifi/data/sites/default/app-unifi-hotspot-portal

To upload those two files to your controller, you will need an FTP client such as https://winscp.net/ or https://filezilla-project.org/ for macOS/Linux users. This software will enable you to connect to your controller and manipulate with its file system easily.

(replace default in the folder structure with your site name if different)

_If the sites folder is not present, you can created it by simply uploading a floorplan (even a dummy one if required) in the UniFi controller which will create the folder you need._

Finally, you will have to purchase and install a valid SSL certificate on your controller. There are a lot of articles and videos about this topic, here is one - <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxhY71ebc9o'>Unifi SSL installation</a>

 ! You must also install a valid SSL certificate on your controller/AP, in order to avoid authentication issues !
 
 This certificate needs to have a unique common name - for example unifi.yourdomain.com
 
 Guide on how to install an SSL certificate on Ubiquiti Unifi can be found here - https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/10134/33/installing-an-ssl-certificate-on-ubiquiti-unifi/
 
https://community.ui.com/questions/How-to-install-a-SSL-Certificate-on-Unifi-Cloud-Key/944dbbd6-cbf6-4112-bff5-6b992fcbf2c4

An SSL certificate can only be purchased for a domain, therefore, you will need to alter your DNS records so that this hostname resolves to the IP address of your controller, for example: unifi.yourdomain.com -> 192.168.1.10

After uploading the SSL certificate to your controller, you need to switch on the **"Use Secure Portal"** and **"Redirect using hostname"** options and enter the hostname from the SSL certificate, for example https://unifi.yourdomain.com
